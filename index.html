                    <strong>Weight training</strong> is essential for causing muscular hypertrophy which is the increase in muscle mass.
                    Train intensely and consistently. Aim to progressivle overload each workout, meaning that you are doing
                    more each session.

                    Proper <strong>nutrition</strong> is extremely important when bulking. It's necessary that you fuel your body 
                    with the adequate amounts of food in order to be in a caloric surplus. Addtionally, it's crucial to consume enough
                    protein to support muscle protein synthesis.

                    <strong>Recovery</strong> is significant factor for gaining muscle mass as it is the process where muscle
                    building occurs. Ensure that you are getting proper amounnts of sleep in order to  allow your 
                    body to repair the microtrauma that occurs from physical exercise.

                    <strong>Supplements</strong>, although not required, can be very beneficial in the process of bulking. They allow
                    you to easily consume important nutrients that you may be lacking with your diet. Certain supplements
                    have been proven to assist in the process of gaining muscle such as creatine.
