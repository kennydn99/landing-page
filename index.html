                    with the adequate amounts of food in order to be in a caloric surplus. Addtionally, it's crucial to consume enough
                    protein to support muscle protein synthesis.

                    Supplements, although not required, can be very beneficial in the process of bulking. They allow
                    you to easily consume important nutrients that you may be lacking with your diet. Certain supplements
                    have been proven to assist in the process of gaining muscle such as creatine.
